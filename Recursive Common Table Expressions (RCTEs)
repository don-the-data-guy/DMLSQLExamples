-- Recursive Common Table Expressions (RCTEs):
-- Description: RCTEs allow you to perform hierarchical queries and traverse tree-like structures within your data. They are particularly useful for scenarios like:
-- Organizational hierarchies: Finding all employees reporting to a manager, traversing up the entire chain of command.
-- Graph traversal: Identifying paths or connections in complex relationships.
-- Example:
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id, employee_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id = 12345 -- Starting point (e.g., CEO)

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.employee_name
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
